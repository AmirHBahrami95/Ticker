bc when using the coinlore api, there are too many coins so giving us a full list of 10million+ (idk the real number it's a guess)
coin records is gonna eph their systems so up that serving free api ain't gonna be worth it

so they decided the're gonna give you a list in some range manner. therefore whenever you need wanna get a hold of coin's list
you need to call their api

but there's a caveat: each time you call their api to get top 100 (or N) coins, the list MIGHT be different. in end effect, you
have to pull the list each time, if you don't have the id's saved in your local storage

so for that reason I figured: why not just save coins whenever you pull them?

also - there's something I couldn't do anything about: there's no search api by symbol! therefore there's really no better strategy
to pull id's by ranges (from 200 to say 300) and save them in a sqlite3 database

and thus, all the "init" fuss!
